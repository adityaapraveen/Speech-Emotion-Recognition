# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
This project implements a deep learning model for recognizing emotions in speech using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It processes speech signals to extract features, trains an LSTM-based neural network, and accurately predicts the emotional state of the speaker.
